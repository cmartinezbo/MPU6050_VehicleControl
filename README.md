# Vehicle Control System using Inertial Sensor Fusion

## Overview
This project implements a control system for vehicles using the fusion of inertial data collected from the **MPU6050** sensor. The system aims to improve motion control and stability by leveraging real-time data from accelerometers and gyroscopes.

## Features
- **Sensor Fusion**: Combines accelerometer and gyroscope data using a complementary filter or Kalman filter for precise orientation estimation.
- **Vehicle Stability Control**: Monitors and adjusts the vehicle's dynamics for improved stability.
- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Achieves low-latency data handling suitable for responsive control systems using ESP-NOW protocol.
- **Error Handling and Filtering**: Includes algorithms for noise reduction and error compensation.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement advanced fusion algorithms (e.g., Extended Kalman Filter).
- Add support for additional sensors like magnetometers.
- Integrate with a feedback system for adaptive control.
- Provide a mobile or web-based dashboard for monitoring.
